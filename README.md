# DITD
A dungeon crawler horror game
If you are intrested in helping develop this project, please email me at siggysalmon@gmail.com we can get started. Any help with coding, writing, 3D/2D asset creation 
or UI would be much appriated. Your time spent on this game is purely voluntary and I am not paying for hours working on the project (i am broke) and this just to have
fun and get experience and practice making a game.
